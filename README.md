Minecraft Java Log File Organizer (MJLFO)

Welcome everyone to my first public project! Recently I wanted to check old chats from my Minecraft: Java Edition .log files, but it was pretty difficult to read it all, and it was often very messy.

So I decided to make a small program, which can generate way cleaner log files: it makes only the chat messages stay, and removes additional useless text or in-game text formatting cases (which make log files even more cluttered). You can also choose to keep only or remove the lines with particular strings, or also remove those strings while keeping the lines. I really liked the final effect, and I decided to share it with everyone (cause why not?).

If you'd like to modify or update the program, for yourself, a closed group, or the public - feel free to do so! MJLFO is distributed under GNU GPL v3.0 license. The program comes with absolutely no warranty. I'm not responsible for any damage that however and for whatever reason my program could be blamed for. As I hardly ever use GitHub, I doubt I'd answer to any issues or pull requests. But you still can post them - maybe someone else would help you. Because I'm so rarely there, if you'd like to share your version of MJLFO, you'd better make a repository yourself and put it there, I don't mind it. You just have to mention me as the original author.

MJLFO might be recognized by some Windows anti-malware as a virus, but it's only a false positive, and detected just because it doesn't have a paid Microsoft code signing key (I'm not paying for that). You can freely disable such software while using MJLFO, or better add an exception, so it won't get removed by your anti-virus programs.

Have fun and enjoy using!
